      <h1 class="h1-2">About Me</h1>
      <h2 class="h2-1">I am the creator of the APJ Productions company, although I don't technically have rights over it I still call it a company. A company in spirit if you will. I also have branches like APJ Productions: Cinema, APJ Productions: Game Studio, etc. I yo-yo, play only the most refined video games, do house duties, write, and create "art" I guess. I'm homeschooled homeschooler which is by far the greatest acomplishment other than the tremendous achievment of life. I am the youngest of six which means I have five older siblings which I do love very much and would probably kill hundreds of thousands of people for any of them although that does kind of go against church teachings so that probably wouldn't go over well... My best friend is my sister, I have two but the one closest in age to me which is also the second youngest, who isn't my twin by birth but is essentially my twin. We have a twin connection where we finish eachothers sentences and think in a similar way. Did I mention that I'm somewhat addicted to certain video games? Well I'm addicted to certain video games. Such as: all of The Legend of Zelda games, primarily Tears of the Kingdom, which I could talk about for about five days straight. That's about it. I like other Nintendo games but not as much as The Legend of Zelda series.</h2>

      <h1 class="h1-2">Experience</h1>
      <h2 class="h2-6">My experience regarding coding languages and other coding-like experiences include: Python 2 & 3, Java, C++, and small amount of use in Unity. IDE's used: Eclipse and Atom. My intrest is lead in a programming and game development/design trajectory and is mostly computer science orientated direction. All of the projects that I am working on currently are in the early early stage which is mainly storyboarding and writing notes. My hope is that I can get my second project out and released by the time I graduate from college, but that means that I'm going to learn how to use Godot or Unreal thanks to Unity's new policy.</h2>
